*   **Primary colors:** are sets of colors that can be combined to make a useful range of colors. The primary colors are those which cannot be created by mixing other colors in a given color space

1.  RYB system of red, yellow, blue, especially used by artists.
2.  RGB system of red, green, blue in television and computer screens.
