Apple announced wireless debugging feature on Xcode 9 at WWDC 17.

#### Apple say Cut the¬†Cord

> _Choose any of your iOS or tvOS devices on the local network to install, run, and debug your apps‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwithout a USB cord plugged into your Mac. Simply click the ‚ÄòConnect via Network‚Äô checkbox the first time you use a new iOS device, and that device will be available over the network from that point forward. Wireless development also works in other apps, including Instruments, Accessibility Inspector, Quicktime Player, and¬†Console._

### **Steps to Cut the¬†Cord**

> Make sure you have at least¬†**Xcode 9 or later**¬†and a device with¬†**iOS 11 or later**

1.  Open your project on Xcode
2.  Plug in your iPhone with USB cable (Just for the first time)
3.  Open Window > Devices and Simulators (cmd + shift + 2)

You should see your device as connected devices

4\. Select your device from left and Check the ‚ÄúConnect via network‚Äù box
