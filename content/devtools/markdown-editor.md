## About Markdown Editor

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

### Usage Tips

1. **Write in the left panel** and see the preview in the right panel.
2. Use the formatting buttons above to quickly insert Markdown syntax.
3. Download your document or copy the markdown to use elsewhere.

### Common Markdown Syntax

| Element | Syntax |
| ------- | ------ |
| Heading | `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3` |
| Bold | `**bold text**` |
| Italic | `*italic text*` |
| Link | `[title](https://www.example.com)` |
| Image | `![alt text](image.jpg)` |
| Code | `` `code` `` |
| List | `- item` or `1. item` |
