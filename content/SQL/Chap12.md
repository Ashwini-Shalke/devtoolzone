There are several special operators that serve specific purposes beyond basic comparison and arithmetic operations.

  

## **Some of these special operators include:**

**LIKE Operator**:
The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. It's commonly used with wildcard characters such as `%` (matches any sequence of characters) and `_` (matches any single character).

```html
SELECT \* FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';
```

---

**IN Operator:** 
The `IN` operator is used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. It checks if a value matches any value in a list.

  
```html
SELECT \* FROM Products WHERE Category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Books');
```

---
**BETWEEN Operator:** 
The `BETWEEN` operator is used to select values within a specified range. It's inclusive, meaning it includes both the start and end values.

```html
SELECT \* FROM Sales WHERE SaleDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```
---
**IS NULL Operator:** 
The `IS NULL` operator is used to check if a column contains a NULL value.
  
```html
SELECT \* FROM Customers WHERE Email IS NULL;
```
---
**EXISTS Operator:** 
The `EXISTS` operator is used to check if a subquery returns any rows. It returns true if the subquery returns one or more rows, otherwise false.

```html
SELECT \* FROM Orders WHERE EXISTS (SELECT \* FROM OrderDetails WHERE Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID);
```

---

**UNION Operator:** 
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It removes duplicate rows by default.

SELECT City FROM Customers UNION SELECT City FROM Suppliers;

  

These special operators provide additional flexibility and functionality in SQL queries, allowing you to perform more complex operations and achieve specific requirements.
