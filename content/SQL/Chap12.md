There are several special operators that serve specific purposes beyond basic comparison and arithmetic operations.

**Some of these special operators include:**

**LIKE Operator**: The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. It's commonly used with wildcard characters such as `%` (matches any sequence of characters) and `_` (matches any single character).

_Example:_ `_SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';_`

**IN Operator:** The `IN` operator is used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. It checks if a value matches any value in a list.

_Example:_ `_SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Books');_`

**BETWEEN Operator:** The `BETWEEN` operator is used to select values within a specified range. It's inclusive, meaning it includes both the start and end values.

_Example:_ `_SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE SaleDate BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';_`

**IS NULL Operator:** The `IS NULL` operator is used to check if a column contains a NULL value.

_Example:_ `_SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Email IS NULL;_`

**EXISTS Operator:** The `EXISTS` operator is used to check if a subquery returns any rows. It returns true if the subquery returns one or more rows, otherwise false.

_Example:_ `_SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM OrderDetails WHERE Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID);_`

**UNION Operator:** The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. It removes duplicate rows by default.

_Example:_ `_SELECT City FROM Customers UNION SELECT City FROM Suppliers;_`

### These special operators provide additional flexibility and functionality in SQL queries, allowing you to perform more complex operations and achieve specific requirements.
