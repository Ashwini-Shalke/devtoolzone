To know the difference between ref cursor and cursor , first you should know what is [cursor](https://medium.com/dev-genius/what-is-a-cursor-in-sql-369cb626048d) and [ref\_cursor](https://medium.com/@ashwinishalke050/understanding-ref-cursor-in-sql-explained-simply-with-examples-ba1b694e111f).

### REF\_CURSOR:

**Dynamic Result Sets:** REF\_CURSOR, or reference cursor, is a **_data type_** that represents a cursor variable. It allows for dynamic result sets to be returned from stored procedures or functions in Oracle.

**Data Pointing:** REF\_CURSOR does not hold actual data but acts as a reference to the result set generated by a query. It points to the memory location where the result set resides.

**Flexibility:** REF\_CURSOR provides more flexibility as it allows the result set to be processed outside the procedure or function, enabling greater control and manipulation of the data in the calling program.

### CURSOR:

**Static Result Sets:** CURSOR is a **_database object_** used to retrieve data row by row, typically within a PL/SQL block. It is explicitly declared and defined to fetch a specific set of data from the database.

**Data Storage:** Unlike REF\_CURSOR, a CURSOR holds the actual result set in memory. It stores the rows fetched from the database until they are processed or the cursor is closed.

**Scoped:** CURSORs are scoped within the PL/SQL block where they are declared. They cannot be passed as parameters to other procedures or functions directly.

In essence, REF\_CURSOR offers more flexibility by allowing dynamic result sets to be passed between procedures/functions and the calling program, while CURSOR provides a more straightforward approach to fetching and processing data within a specific PL/SQL block.
