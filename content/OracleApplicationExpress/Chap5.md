When you interact with an APEX application, the APEX engine orchestrates two key processes to make things happen smoothly: **Show Page** and **Accept Page.**

### Show Page

1.  Imagine this process as the stage where the magic unfolds. When you click a button or navigate to a certain page in your APEX application, the Show Page process springs into action. It’s responsible for presenting the requested page to you, the user.

2.  Let’s say you’re using an APEX application to manage your bookstore. You click on the “View Books” button, and voila! The Show Page process swings into action, displaying a list of available books on your screen. This process ensures that the right information is presented to you at the right time, making your user experience seamless and delightful.

### Accept Page

1.  Now, let’s dive into the Accept Page process, which is like the silent guardian working behind the scenes. When you interact with elements on a page, such as submitting a form or clicking a button to perform an action, the Accept Page process takes charge.

2.  Continuing with our bookstore example, let’s say you want to order a book. You fill out a simple form with your details and hit the “Order Now” button. That’s when the Accept Page process springs into action, capturing your inputs, processing them, and executing the necessary actions, such as updating the database with your order details.

### Example

Let’s tie it all together with a straightforward example. Imagine you’re using an APEX application to manage your grocery list. You navigate to the “Add Items” page to add some items to your list. This action triggers the Show Page process, which displays the form where you can enter the details of the items you want to add.

Once you’ve filled out the form and hit the “Add” button, the Accept Page process swings into action. It accepts the information you’ve provided, processes it, and adds the items to your grocery list. Voila! You’ve successfully added items to your list with just a few clicks.

In conclusion, understanding the Show Page and Accept Page processes is essential for harnessing the full potential of APEX applications. These processes work hand in hand to deliver a seamless user experience, ensuring that the right information is presented to users at the right time, and their interactions are captured and processed efficiently.


So, the next time you interact with an APEX application, remember the Show Page and Accept Page processes silently working behind the scenes to make your experience smooth and hassle-free.
