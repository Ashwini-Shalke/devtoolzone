      <description>TCL commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
COMMIT: The COMMIT command is used to permanently save the changes made during the current transaction. Once a COMMIT command is executed, all changes made within the transaction become permanent and are visible to other users. Example:Suppose we have a transaction that updates the age of a student in the database:
BEGIN TRANSACTION; UPDATE Students SET Age = 16 WHERE Name = &amp;lsquo;Alice&amp;rsquo;; COMMIT;</description>

      <description>Imagine you have a big collection of toys scattered all over your room. You want to find your favorite toy, but searching through the mess by yourself might take a lot of time and effort. Here’s where your friend SQL comes in!
