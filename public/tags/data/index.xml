      <description>Introduction to SQL Imagine your room filled with video games, books, and snacks. Finding that one game you want to play? Total chaos! Now, think of SQL as your super-organized friend who knows exactly where everything is.

      <description>Imagine this: You have a gigantic snack box filled with all kinds of snacks — chips, cookies, chocolates, and more. But finding exactly what you want is tough, especially with so many options mixed up together! SQL (Structured Query Language) is like a personal assistant for organizing and finding things in your snack box.

      <description>Imagine you run a smoothie shop, and each customer can customize their smoothie with different add-ons, like protein powder, extra fruit, and chia seeds. You want a quick way to calculate the total sale price of each smoothie based on its base price and the cost of each add-on. Instead of calculating the total price manually every time, we’ll create a user-defined function to do it for us!
Example: Defining the Function Let’s say you have a SmoothieSales table, and you want to calculate each smoothie’s total price by adding the base price and each add-on.</description>
